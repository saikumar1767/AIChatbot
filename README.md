# AI-Powered Web Application Documentation

## Objective:

This project aims to develop a simple AI-powered web application using Python, Flask, and MySQL, enabling users to interact with a basic AI model. The application features a user-friendly interface where users can input data and view responses generated by the AI model. Users can view their chat history. The code is well-structured, commented, and available in a GitHub repository.

## Requirements:

1. **Application Setup:**
   - Initialize a Flask web application.
   - Set up a MySQL database to store user queries and AI responses.

2. **AI Integration:**
   - Integrate a simple AI model (e.g., a text classification model or a chatbot) into the application.
   - Utilize pre-trained models from libraries like `transformers` or any other suitable library.

3. **User Interface:**
   - Develop a simple and intuitive web interface allowing users to:
     - Input data to interact with the AI model.
     - View the AI model's responses.
   - Include basic navigation and user feedback mechanisms.

4. **Database Interaction:**
   - Store user inputs and AI responses in the MySQL database.
   - Implement functionality to retrieve past interactions from the database and display them on the website.

5. **Error Handling and Validation:**
   - Implement error handling to manage and respond to potential failures or invalid inputs.
   - Validate user inputs to ensure they meet expected formats or criteria before processing.

6. **Documentation and Code Quality:**
   - Comment code adequately to explain critical sections and logic.
   - Include a README file in the GitHub repository with:
     - Instructions on how to set up and run the application.
     - A brief description of the application's functionality.
     - Any necessary information about the AI model used.

7. **GitHub Repository:**
   - Push code to a GitHub repository.
   - Ensure the repository is public and contains all necessary files to run the application, excluding sensitive information like database credentials.


## Usage:

1. **Setup:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Installation:**
   - Install Python and required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Database Setup:**
   - Set up a MySQL database and configure database credentials in the Flask application.
   - Run the provided SQL script to create the necessary tables.

4. **Running the Application:**
   - Execute `python app.py` to start the Flask server.
   - Access the application via the provided URL in your web browser.

5. **Interacting with the Application:**
   - Input data in the provided interface to interact with the AI model.
   - View responses generated by the AI model and past interactions in the chat history section.
